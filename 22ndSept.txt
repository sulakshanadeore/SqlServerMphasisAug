4)	Add a constraint Price < 2500 to Book table.
5)	View all the constraints for table Issue_C using view User_Constraints.
6)	Disable constraint created in step 3-d
7)	Create a Read Only view to display Lib_Issue_Id, Book_Name, Member_Name, Author and Issue_date for all the books that have price between 500 – 750 and category as Database or RDBMS.
8)	Create a view with check option to display all the books that has price greater then 500.
